# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

My resume displays a home page, with links to my “About”, “Resume”, and “Leap Experience”. Although I am very pleased with the final project and what I was able to accomplish, in the future I would like to implement more detailed code in my matrix background. Using images, indexes, and speed to give the illusion of the matrix code had its challenges, but with more time and knowledge, I would like to write the code for the background.

There are a couple different ways to view the completed project. After cloning the project from https://github.com/LaRyder/CapstoneResume.git and opening in VS code, running “NMP start” will built the application on the local host. Hosting the website provides an alternative way to view. Please follow the link. https://laurenresume.azurewebsites.net/.

MVP:
P0: Website with “About”, “Resume”, “Contact”, and “Leap Experience” pages.
P1: Animation
P2: Extra coding project (Matrix background on Leap Experience page)
